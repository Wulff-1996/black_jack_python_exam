## Black Jack Game Assignment 2
This assignment is for the python elective exam assignment 2. Project description and setup is explained below.

## Project Description
This application is a script that allows the user to play the game of Black Jack, and is terminal based. The game is a one player game where he/she can decide to be either the player or the dealer. There is also implemented a bet functionality where the game continues until the player is out of money, if so the player has the option to either begin a new game or exit the application. There is also implemented logic for the computer when to hit or stay, and how much to bet. The dealer always have to stand at 17 or more, that also applies to the player if the player chooses to be the dealer. In dealer mode, the player will have to press any key for the game to continue, and the terminal clears after every new screen.

## Project Structure
The game is created with both procedural- and object oriented programming. Classes has been created for the custom object, and because some objects have multiple instances.

## Project Run
1: navigate to the file called main.py
2: execute the cmd python3 main.py
3: a terminal will open and the game will begin

## Set Up
1: download or clone this repository
2: no third party libraries are used, so it is enough to just have python 3.7 or above installed
3: happy betting
